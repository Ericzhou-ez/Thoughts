# Thoughts
Studies show that journaling can be a key factor in improving and maintaing good mental health. It decreases anxiety, stimulates self-awareness, and helps the brain to process complex events and feelings. The only thing missing from a good journal session is feedback. That where **Thoughts** comes in. Share your day and Thoughts will summarize the overall sentiment from your entry, helping you to identify the feelings that come up. Look back on your week, month, or year; and see how your emotions have changed day by day.
